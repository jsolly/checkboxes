# Checkboxes.xyz

A collection of checkbox implementations using different frameworks and approaches.


## Features

- Multiple implementation examples:
  - React
  - Vue.js
  - Svelte
  - Alpine.js
  - Vanilla JavaScript
  - Hyperscript
  - CSS Only
  - jQuery
- Syntax highlighted collapsible code snippets
- Performance metrics for each implementation
## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Generate performance metrics
pnpm generate-stats
```

## Contributing

To add a new implementation, create a new directory in the `src/components` directory with the framework name. Then create a file with the implementation and a container file with the display wrapper.

At this point, you could open a PR, but if you want to add the whole integration, see the [Astro Framework Integration Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations/). This usually involves modifying the `astro.config.mjs` file to add the framework and its configuration.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more frameworks (Angular, Solid.js)
- Add performance comparisons [x]
- Create interactive playground [ ]
- Add more complex checkbox scenarios [ ]

## Notes on Performance Metrics

Each framework implementation is measured using the following methodology:

### Measurement Process
- **Number of Runs**: 5 iterations per framework
- **Metrics Collected**:
  - Render Time: Time until framework is ready (or DOM interactive as fallback)
  - Bundle Size: Total JavaScript bundle size in KB

### How Metrics are Calculated
- **Render Time**: 
  - Primary: Uses `window.frameworkReady` timing when available
  - Fallback: Uses `domInteractive` timing from Performance API
  - Final value is the median of 5 measurements
- **Bundle Size**: 
  - Measures total size of all JavaScript files
  - Includes framework code and implementation code
  - Reports compressed (gzipped) size

### Performance Badge Colors
Each metric is compared to other frameworks using Z-scores (standard deviations from mean):
- ðŸŸ¢ **Dark Green** (-1.5 or lower): Much faster/smaller than average
- ðŸŸ© **Light Green** (-1.5 to -0.5): Better than average
- ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow** (-0.5 to 0.5): Average performance
- ðŸŸ§ **Orange** (0.5 to 1.5): Worse than average
- ðŸŸ¥ **Red** (1.5 or higher): Much slower/larger than average

For example, with current measurements:
- VanillaJS render time (Z=-2.48): ðŸŸ¢ Much faster than average
- React bundle size (Z=1.67): ðŸŸ¥ Much larger than average
- Alpine render time (Z=0.35): ðŸŸ¨ Average performance

### Technical Details
- Measurements use Puppeteer in a controlled environment
- Navigation timing via `performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")`
- Bundle sizes tracked via Chrome DevTools Protocol
- Z-scores automatically calculated during build
- Results stored in `src/data/framework-stats.json`
